# Suppression List for Future Sends

## Requirements

We’ve been doing a bit of list hygiene work ahead of our Q4 campaigns, and we’d love your help creating a suppression list we can use moving forward to clean up our sends.

People who meet the following criteria should be excluded from future campaign:
- They’ve explicitly opted out of email
- They haven’t opened or clicked anything in the last 12 months
- They have an inactive status and a mailing address that’s missing or incomplete
- Their email address ends in something suspicious like @test.com, @fake.com, or @example.com

This will become the go-to suppression list across journeys and ad-hoc campaigns.
