# Project Brief - Lumos Collective

 We’re running a big 48-hour Flash Sale starting this weekend, and I need your help with the audience pull.  

## Requirements
- They must be Active customers.  
- Target customers who either:  
   - purchased in the last 180 days AND their preferred category is Shoes or Bags  
   - Or they’ve been browsing recently (last browse date within the last 14 days).  

Also, create a custom field in the output called SaleUrgency for the email team.
- If someone’s last browse date was within the last 7 days → mark as Hot.  
- If it was 8–14 days → mark as Warm.  
- Otherwise, just mark as Cold.
