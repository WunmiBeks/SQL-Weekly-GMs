We’ve got our Spring Refresh campaign going out this Friday, and I just need a quick audience pulled for the email send.

Basically, we want to target people who:

- are in Australia or New Zealand
- haven’t bought anything in a while - maybe last 6 months?
- and they have to be opted-in to email.

We’re planning to drop their first name into the subject line too, so if any of the names are all lowercase or look weird, can you fix that so it’s propercased?

Also - we’re offering a 20% off coupon in the email. Feel free to just create one in the output like SPRING20 or something else that makes sense. We’ll pass that field over to the email team to use in the dynamic content.
